Your current implementation uses a simple
generateObject approach with a single
prompt. While functional, it lacks: - Multi-step reasoning capabilities - Dynamic scheduling adjustments - Learning pattern analysis - Real-time constraint validation

    Proposed Enhancements

    1. Convert to AI Agent Architecture

    Transform the route from simple generation
    to an Agent-based system with tools:

    // lib/ai/timetable-agent.ts
    const timetableAgent = new Agent({
      model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp',
      system: 'Expert GCSE revision scheduler
    with pedagogical knowledge',
      tools: {
        analyzeTopicDifficulty,
        calculateSpacedRepetition,
        checkTimeConflicts,
        optimizeSessionDistribution,
        generateBreakSchedule
      },
      stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)
    });

    2. Implement Specialized Tools

    a) Topic Analysis Tool
    - Analyzes topic complexity based on subject
     and name
    - Estimates required study time
    - Suggests optimal session types
    (new-learning vs revision)

    b) Spaced Repetition Calculator
    - Implements Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
    - Calculates optimal revision intervals (1
    day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks)
    - Adjusts based on topic difficulty

    c) Time Conflict Resolver
    - Validates against school hours
    - Checks for overlapping sessions
    - Ensures proper break times between
    sessions

    d) Session Distribution Optimizer
    - Balances subjects across days
    - Prevents cognitive overload
    - Mixes difficult/easy topics
    - Implements Pomodoro technique variations

    e) Break Schedule Generator
    - Inserts appropriate breaks based on
    session intensity
    - Considers time of day (longer breaks in
    evening)
    - Adds meal breaks at appropriate times

    3. Enhanced Data Models

    Add new schemas for better AI reasoning:

    // lib/schema.ts additions
    const studyPatternSchema = z.object({
      topicId: z.string(),
      estimatedDifficulty:
    z.number().min(1).max(5),
      requiredHours: z.number(),
      optimalSessionType: z.enum(['intensive',
    'distributed']),
      prerequisiteTopics:
    z.array(z.string()).optional()
    });

    const revisionCycleSchema = z.object({
      topicId: z.string(),
      cycles: z.array(z.object({
        dayOffset: z.number(), // Days from
    initial learning
        sessionType: z.enum(['review',
    'practice', 'test']),
        duration: z.number() // minutes
      }))
    });

    4. Multi-Step Agent Workflow

    The agent will:
    1. Analyze all topics for difficulty and
    time requirements
    2. Calculate spaced repetition schedules for
     each topic
    3. Generate initial session distribution
    4. Check and resolve time conflicts
    5. Optimize for cognitive load and variety
    6. Add appropriate breaks and buffer time
    7. Validate final schedule meets all
    constraints
    8. Return structured timetable with metadata

    5. Implementation Files

    New files to create:
    - lib/ai/timetable-agent.ts - Main agent
    configuration
    - lib/ai/tools/index.ts - Tool
    implementations
    - lib/ai/tools/topic-analyzer.ts - Topic
    complexity analysis
    - lib/ai/tools/spaced-repetition.ts - Memory
     curve calculations
    - lib/ai/tools/schedule-optimizer.ts -
    Distribution optimization
    - lib/ai/tools/conflict-resolver.ts - Time
    conflict resolution
    - lib/ai/prompts/timetable-prompts.ts -
    Structured prompts

    Files to modify:
    - app/api/ai/generate-timetable/route.ts -
    Use agent.generate() instead
    - lib/schema.ts - Add new schemas for tools
    - store/revision-store.ts - Handle enhanced
    response data

    6. Benefits of This Approach

    1. Better Accuracy: Multi-step reasoning
    improves schedule quality
    2. Explainability: Each tool provides
    reasoning for decisions
    3. Flexibility: Easy to add/modify
    individual tools
    4. Reliability: Validation at each step
    reduces errors
    5. Personalization: Tools can adapt to user
    patterns over time
    6. Maintainability: Separated concerns,
    testable components

    7. Future Enhancements

    Once implemented, you can easily add:
    - Progress tracking tool (adjusts future
    schedules based on completion)
    - Exam date prioritization (increases
    frequency as exams approach)
    - Energy level optimization (harder topics
    when most alert)
    - Integration with calendar APIs
    - Voice command support via message dock

    This architecture transforms your simple
    timetable generator into an intelligent
    study companion that truly understands
    educational psychology and adapts to student
     needs.
